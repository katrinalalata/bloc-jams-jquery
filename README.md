# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app

## Overview and Purpose 
In this project, I initialized the Bloc Jams jQuery project, became familiar with the existing code, and used jQuery to insert information into the DOM.
I was responsible for refactoring an existing code base using jQuery.

The finished app is a fully functional music player. It will display album information, list the songs for an album, and include standard music controls for playing, pausing, skipping forward/backward, and adjusting the volume.
